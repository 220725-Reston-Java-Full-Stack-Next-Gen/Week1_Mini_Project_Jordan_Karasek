Project Title: Foundational Project - JAK Employee Reimbursement System
Executive Summary: This is an expense reimbursement system that will allow employees to submit requests for reimbursment. Mangers will need be able to view and approve or deny expenses through this single application. This is a basic application program interface (API) for the reimbursement process excluding a graphical user interface (GUI). System will be center hub for users logging in and accessing a database for the reimbursement process. Employee and Manager users will have different permissions and access to the data as well as user log in profiles.

User Stories: 
As an employee, I want to create a username and password, so that I can create a new account.

MVP- Employees must be able to log into the application using a username and password input, register a new account, submit reimbursement tickets with amount and description, and finally view previous submissions by filtering a Pending, Approved, or Denied status.
Stretch Statement- Employees might include reimbursement types like food or travel. They could add images of reciepts to requests uploaded to SQL or cloud storage. Might include more user information like name and address. Might allow more editing control of user account plus ability to add profile pictures.

MVP- Managers will have the ability to log into the application using a username and password input. Managers can Approve or Deny ticket submissions from employees as well as change status of approval after processing.
Stretch Statement- Managers might be able to change other users or employee roles from employee to manager or the reverse.
